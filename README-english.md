# poetrypage
My first try to make one site only using HTML5, CSS3 and grid styling! Sorry for lack of techniques ;) 

This page have a purpose to show simple concepts about "new" front-end standards, based on HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript ES6 languages.

FEEL FREE TO COPY OR MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CODE (comments are welcome!)

*ABOUT HTML USED:

IMPORTANT! SEO concepts won't be used or allowed here. In the future I'll be make a special project for that purpose.

The structure respect the new semantic concept for HTML, which makes it easyer to be understood and avoid unnecessary DIV's and ID's use.
In the future, I'll work on acessibility features and a tool to make posts from scratch (like blog posts). Uh, and make more pages too ;)

*ABOUT THE CSS USED:

The  Style are based on just simple CSS grid, making a responsive fluidity.
Also, the page have a superb use of rich styles to show it's possible to be implemented without plugins or frameworks, which deliver fast 
and easy-to-read pages.

In the future, will be necessary the use of mixins and boilerplates due incompatibility issues on real enviroment, and weak 
browsers (aka IE hell). Complex grid concepts also be used, but the theory about grid areas and subgrids are just abstractions about grid
usage.

*ABOUT JAVASCRIPT USED:

NOTHING!!! 
Despite your use can be added for future use. If want to use it here, if possible, use vanilla form and add comments.


Be welcome and enjoy!!!
